# Boiled-Leather
A script to create the boiled leather reading order of AFFC and ADWD (a part of the A Song of Ice and Fire series).

Forked from https://github.com/slowboard/Boiled-Leather. \
Adaptions made to BoiledLeather.py to make the Python script to work in MacOS (OS X).\
Cleanup of files that I don't need.
